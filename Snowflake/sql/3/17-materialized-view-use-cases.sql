-- 17.0.0  Materialized View Use Cases
--         In this lab you will learn and practice the following:
--         - Cluster a Table using a Timestamp Column Type
--         - Cluster a Table to Improve Performance
--         - Automatic Transparent Rewrite on Materialized Views
--         - Materialized Views on External Tables
--         In this lab you will be working with Materialized Views. A
--         materialized view is a pre-computed data set derived from a query
--         specification (the SELECT in the view definition) and stored for
--         later use. Because the data is pre-computed, querying a materialized
--         view is faster than executing a query against the base table of the
--         view.

-- 17.1.0  Cluster a Table Using a Timestamp Column

-- 17.1.1  Open a new worksheet or Create Worksheet from SQL File and set your
--         context

USE ROLE training_role;
USE DATABASE BADGER_db;
USE SCHEMA public;
USE WAREHOUSE BADGER_wh;
ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT=TRUE;



-- 17.1.2  Create a table using cloning


CREATE TABLE weblog CLONE training_db.traininglab.weblog;


-- 17.1.3  Check the clustering quality of the CREATE_MS and METRIC9 columns

SELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION( 'weblog' , '(create_ms)');

SELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION( 'weblog' , '(metric9)');

--         Compare the clustering information results. Which column is more
--         effectively clustered?

-- 17.1.4  Run a query with a search filter using the column CREATE_MS

SELECT COUNT(*) CNT
     , AVG(time_on_load_ms) AVG_TIME_ON_LOAD
FROM WEBLOG
WHERE create_ms BETWEEN 1000000000 AND 1000001000;


-- 17.1.5  View the query profile to check micro-partition pruning
--         Click on the TableScan[2] node in the diagram and examine the
--         partition statistics.
--         TableScan[2] Node Details
--         In this case, the micro-partition pruning is very good.

-- 17.1.6  Check the clustering quality of the column PAGE_ID
--         Based on the column name - would you expect it to be well-clustered,
--         or poorly clustered?

SELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION( 'weblog' , '(page_id)' );

--         Were you right?

-- 17.1.7  Run a query that filters in the PAGE_ID
--         Since PAGE_ID is not well-clustered, you would expect the micro-
--         partition pruning to be low.

SELECT COUNT(*) CNT
     , AVG(time_on_load_ms) AVG_TIME_ON_LOAD
FROM WEBLOG
WHERE page_id=100000;


-- 17.1.8  Check the micro-partition pruning in the query profile
--         Click on the TableScan[2] node in the diagram and examine the
--         partition statistics.
--         TableScan[2] Node Details
--         Note that, as expected, the micro-partition pruning is very low.
--         Record the execution time, and the micro-partition pruning.

-- 17.2.0  Cluster a Table to Improve Query Performance
--         You would like both queries - the one filtered by PAGE_ID and the one
--         filtered by CREATE_MS - to run fast. But running both queries with
--         equally good performance requires using a second copy of the data
--         thatâ€™s organized differently. You can do this easily with
--         materialized views.

-- 17.2.1  Create a materialized view clustered by PAGE_ID
--         Creating the materialized view with a clustering key causes Snowflake
--         to reorganize the data during the initial creation of the
--         materialized view. Here you will increase the virtual warehouse size
--         so the re-clustering will go faster - but the operation will still
--         take up to 5 minutes. This would be a good time to stretch your legs
--         or refill your coffee.

-- 17.2.2  Set warehouse size

ALTER WAREHOUSE BADGER_wh SET
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = XXLARGE
  WAIT_FOR_COMPLETION = TRUE;

CREATE OR REPLACE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_time_on_load (
  create_ms,
  page_id,
  time_on_load_ms
)
CLUSTER BY (page_id)
AS
SELECT
  create_ms,
  page_id,
  time_on_load_ms
FROM weblog;


-- 17.2.3  Check clustering efficiency on the PAGE_ID column of the materialized
--         view

SELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION ( 'mv_time_on_load' , '(page_id)' );

--         After the clustering, the average_depth should be around 2 or 3. This
--         is quite an improvement.

-- 17.2.4  Run the query filtered on PAGE_ID against the materialized view
--         For a proper performance comparison, set the warehouse size back to
--         what it was the first time the query ran.

ALTER WAREHOUSE BADGER_wh SET
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = LARGE
  WAIT_FOR_COMPLETION = TRUE;

SELECT COUNT(*),
       AVG(time_on_load_ms) AVG_TIME_ON_LOAD
FROM mv_time_on_load
WHERE page_id=100000;

--         This example illustrates a substantial improvement in terms of query
--         performance.

-- 17.2.5  Check micro-partition pruning in the query profile
--         With the materialized view, only one micro-partition was scanned.
--         There was a significant increase in performance as a result.

-- 17.2.6  SHOW materialized views on the WEBLOG table

SHOW MATERIALIZED VIEWS ON weblog;


-- 17.3.0  Explore Automatic Transparent Rewrite on Materialized Views
--         The Snowflake query optimizer can exploit materialized views to
--         automatically rewrite/reroute queries made against the source table,
--         to the materialized view.

-- 17.3.1  Use EXPLAIN to see if a command will use a source table or a
--         materialized view
--         Use explain to check if a query against the original source table
--         will use a materialized view for query performance

EXPLAIN
  SELECT COUNT(*) CNT,
         AVG(time_on_load_ms) AVG_TIME_ON_LOAD
FROM weblog
WHERE page_id=100000;

--         Note that even though the query was against the WEBLOG table, the
--         EXPLAIN plan shows that the materialized view will be scanned.

-- 17.3.2  Run the query

ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;

SELECT COUNT(*) CNT,
       AVG(time_on_load_ms) AVG_TIME_ON_LOAD
FROM weblog
WHERE page_id=100000;


-- 17.3.3  Check the query profile
--         Even though the query was against the WEBLOG table, the materialized
--         view was scanned instead.

-- 17.4.0  Materialized Views on External Tables

-- 17.4.1  Create a file format for an external table
